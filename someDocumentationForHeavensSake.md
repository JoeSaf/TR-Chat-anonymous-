From the code provided so far, **the individuals do not need to be on the same network** due to the use of **Ngrok** to create a public TCP tunnel. Here's why:

### How Ngrok Works in This Context:
1. **Ngrok Tunnel:** The `CRT_PUB_CON` function uses Ngrok to create a public-facing TCP endpoint that maps to the server's local port (`8089`). This allows devices outside the local network (e.g., over the internet) to connect to the server through the public URL generated by Ngrok.

2. **Public Accessibility:** Once Ngrok sets up the tunnel, the `public_url` returned by Ngrok contains the IP address or hostname and port that external devices can use to connect to the server. This bypasses the need for both the server and client to be on the same network.

3. **Dynamic DNS Handling:** The public URL generated by Ngrok dynamically resolves to the appropriate address, and the tunnel handles NAT traversal and firewall bypass. This ensures clients can connect to the server from any network.

### Key Requirements:
- **Ngrok Running:** The server must have Ngrok running and accessible to provide the public tunnel.
- **Internet Access:** Both the server (hosting Ngrok) and the clients need internet access for communication through the Ngrok tunnel.

### Limitations:
1. **Ngrok Tunnel Stability:** Free Ngrok plans might terminate tunnels after some time, requiring manual re-setup.
2. **Throughput and Latency:** Performance depends on Ngrok's servers and the quality of the internet connection.

### Confirmation from Your Code:
- The `CRT_PUB_CON` function specifically fetches the public URL for external access:
  ```python
  public_url = json_data['tunnels'][0]['public_url']
  ```
- The server binds to `localhost` (`server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8089))`), but the public URL provided by Ngrok allows remote connections.

### Scenarios:
- **Same Network:** Clients can directly use the server's local IP address and port if they're on the same network.
- **Different Networks:** Clients must use the Ngrok-provided public URL to connect.

If the Ngrok process is set up correctly and the public URL is shared with the clients, they can connect from anywhere with an internet connection.

Certainly! Below is a breakdown of the relationships between the files you've provided. It shows how each module interacts with others:

### 1. **`trchat.py`**
   - **Purpose**: This file is the main entry point for your application, presenting a simple menu for the user to either start a server or connect to one.
   - **Interacts with**:
     - **`server.py`**: If the user selects "Start Server," this file imports and runs the `server.py` code.
     - **`client.py`**: If the user selects "Connect with server," this file imports and runs the `client.py` code.

### 2. **`server.py`**
   - **Purpose**: Implements the server that listens for incoming connections, handles message encryption and decryption, and manages communication between clients.
   - **Interacts with**:
     - **`PUB_CON.py`**: Uses the `CRT_PUB_CON()` function from `PUB_CON.py` to establish a public connection via Ngrok and retrieve the public IP address.
     - **`MSG_ENC.py`**: Uses functions like `AES_256_ENCRYPT`, `AES_256_DECRYPT`, `RSA_ENC`, and `GEN_AES_256_KEY` for encryption and decryption of messages and keys between the server and clients.
     - **`client.py`**: The server communicates with clients (via socket connections), receiving encrypted data, decrypting it, and sending back encrypted responses.

### 3. **`client.py`**
   - **Purpose**: This is the client application that connects to the server, sends and receives encrypted messages.
   - **Interacts with**:
     - **`MSG_ENC.py`**: Uses functions like `AES_256_ENCRYPT`, `AES_256_DECRYPT`, and `RSA_DEC` for encrypting and decrypting messages and keys.
     - **`server.py`**: The client connects to the server, sends encrypted messages, and listens for responses. It handles the reception and decryption of messages from the server.

### 4. **`PUB_CON.py`**
   - **Purpose**: Manages the creation of a public TCP connection through Ngrok and retrieves the public URL of the server.
   - **Interacts with**:
     - **`server.py`**: The server uses this file to establish a public connection for external clients to connect to the server via the Ngrok tunnel.

### 5. **`MSG_ENC.py`**
   - **Purpose**: This file handles the encryption and decryption of messages using AES and RSA algorithms.
   - **Interacts with**:
     - **`server.py`**: The server calls functions in this file to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between the server and clients.
     - **`client.py`**: The client uses this file to encrypt and decrypt messages before sending them to the server and after receiving them.

### Flow of Data:
1. **Starting the Server**:
   - `trchat.py` calls `server.py`.
   - `server.py` calls `PUB_CON.py` to establish a public connection using Ngrok.
   - `server.py` uses `MSG_ENC.py` to encrypt/decrypt messages with clients.

2. **Starting the Client**:
   - `trchat.py` calls `client.py`.
   - `client.py` uses `MSG_ENC.py` to encrypt/decrypt messages with the server.
   
---

### Summary of Key Interactions:
- **`trchat.py`** orchestrates the choice of whether to run the server or the client.
- **`server.py`** is the central part of your communication system, relying on **`PUB_CON.py`** for creating a public connection and **`MSG_ENC.py`** for encryption/decryption.
- **`client.py`** connects to the server and communicates securely using **`MSG_ENC.py`** for encryption.

Let me know if you'd like to modify any of these interactions or if you have further questions!


## what was changed in server 2.0

Key Changes:

   ### Automatic Acceptance:
        The server now automatically accepts the client if the authentication passes.
        It skips the manual acceptance step by the operator and instead relies on public key encryption to authenticate the client.


### Benefits:

    No Human Intervention: This removes the need for manual acceptance, improving automation.
    Improved Security: By using key-based authentication, only clients with the correct private key can connect.
    Streamlined Connection Process: Clients are either authenticated and accepted automatically or rejected if their authentication fails.
